# Kucha Mural Information System

the Kucha Mural Information System is a GWT-Based Java Client-Server solution for the research data curation of the project ["Buddhist Murals of Kucha on the Northern Silk Road"](https://www.saw-leipzig.de/de/projekte/wissenschaftliche-bearbeitung-der-buddhistischen-hoehlenmalereien-in-der-kucha-region-der-noerdlichen-seidenstrasse/introduction/kucha-murals). It can store pictures, biographical data, thesaurus information, textual descriptions, cave-information and image-annotations and external ressources as well as connections between research entities.

The research data is stored in a mysql-databse as well as in json-format.

For information, how to set up the Kucha Information System, contact radisch@saw-leipzig.de.
