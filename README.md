# Kucha Mural Information System

the Kucha Mural Information System is a GWT-Based Java Client-Server solution for the research data curation of the project ["Buddhist Murals of Kucha on the Northern Silk Road"](https://www.saw-leipzig.de/de/projekte/wissenschaftliche-bearbeitung-der-buddhistischen-hoehlenmalereien-in-der-kucha-region-der-noerdlichen-seidenstrasse/introduction/kucha-murals). It can store pictures, biographical data, thesaurus information, textual descriptions, cave-information and image-annotations and external ressources as well as connections between research entities.

The research data is stored in a mysql-databse as well as in json-format.

The main dokumentation of the information system is stored and maintained in the internal documantation system of the saxon academy. For information, how to set up the Kucha Information System, contact radisch@saw-leipzig.de.
